The code extracts the final dataset to include only variables with mean and standard error. The extracted data is aggregated to show average values 
for every subject (30 participants) of the study for every six activities (1 LAYING, 2 SITTING, 3 STANDING, 4 WALKING, 5 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
6 WALKING_UPSTAIRS) that were studied. As a result we have 180 data entries in the tidy dataset for .
